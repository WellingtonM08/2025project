# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Make simple and easy to understand webstie to showcase, barber skills for a barber, while also making a booking page on the website for clients to use. 
either that or make a discord mod for finding def deals on tech, like pre builts, gpus, cpus, and all of that. 
another idea was make a game like flappy bird with levels to it and obsticales to make the game unique that would run on andriod (becuase i have windows, i would like to do it for ios but dont own a mac)
another idea was make an app to track progress in the gym, broken down to different muscle groups and having a ranked feature where you can compete with friends. 
another idea was recreate a space ship racing game from my childhood, I used to have loads of fun with called "Wipeout Pure" for the psp. 


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I would like to collabroate but i dont know anyone in the class. 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

is there any way to make an ios app without mac?
